## Overview

This Typing Speed Test application is a desktop tool built with Python's Tkinter library. It allows users to test their typing speed by providing random text samples and measuring the number of words typed per minute (WPM). The application also tracks the highest WPM achieved during a session.

## Features

- **Random Text Samples**: Presents different text samples each time you reset the test.
- **Real-time Typing Speed Calculation**: Calculates and displays your WPM as soon as you finish typing the sample text.
- **High Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the highest WPM score achieved during the current session.
- **Clean and Modern UI**: Designed with a clean and user-friendly interface using Tkinter.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python on most systems)

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typing-speed-test.git
    cd typing-speed-test
    ```

2. **Run the Application**

    ```bash
    python typing_speed_test.py
    ```

## Usage

1. When you run the application, you will be presented with a random text sample.
2. Start typing in the provided input box. Your typing speed (in WPM) will be calculated once you finish typing the sample text.
3. Your WPM and the current high score are displayed in the application.
4. Press the "Reset" button to try another text sample.
